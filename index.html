                <p>1 in 9 people above the age of 45 are effected by short term memory loss. Daily activities become a battle for some making them dependent on others for help. Cunning edge makes these tasks manageable for one with interactive games, keeping up with daily water intake, and daily planners for organization. After implementing our plan they wonâ€™t need as much assistance due to their improved problem solving skills. Allowing them to strengthen their mind to conquer the day!</p>

                <p><aside><img id="Mom" src="images/IMG_CJ.JPG" alt="photo of Carol Collins"></aside>Meet my mom, Carol and I am Christine Jackson. Mom is a smart, witty 70-something year old who was diagnosed with stage four breast cancer. With the help of her family, she is ready to fight but has been effected with something no one ever prepared her for: the never relenting short-term memory loss and struggle of continuing to thrive as an independent person who can prevail.</p>
                <p>Hence the inspiration for this website. It is developed with the tools that we used to enable Carol to not only continue with her life but fight the new challenge of fighting breast cancer and it's effects on her short-term memory loss.</p>
                <p>As the website was developed and the concept was shared with others, people began to see it value for other challenges like ADHD, depression. These tools can help to strengthen the mind and body, and plan and organize for each and every day. </p>

                <p>This project originated as a capstone project for Commonwealth Coders. We were to implement a group project to demonstrate the skills we had learned as we worked as a team. The assignment was undeniably a challenge and we were unable to complete the project. I am continuing to develop the website and its components and hope to enable not only Carol but others...</p>
                <p>Special thanks to Sarah Truesdale and Drew Cables for sticking with me to strive to make this a viable webpage that can create a Plan to Strengthen Lives of others.</p>
